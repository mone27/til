    "The first thing is to add a custom domain in your github account and the in the repo pages settings. I am working with subdomain (not top level domain) so I had to add a CNAME record in my DNS settings poining to `mone27.github.io`.\n",

    "Then you need to add a `CNAME` file in the root of your repo with the custom domain name. In my case it was `til.mone27.net`. Now we need to convince quarto to also bring this file to the output directory (when deploying using CI).\n",
